## HourlyEnergyPrediction

```
This repository contains Models for energy forecasting. Two models have been built using various approaches .
1 . It uses Lstm and sklearn with keras to produce the desired results .
2 . It uses Xgboost model along with time series analysis to build the model .
```
> More such models will be built and uploaded so that we can get the best performing algorithm for forecasting our energy needs .
